# ----------Build Design Complete------------

# After Build:
   - Make it responsive âœ…
   - Add own Animation:

        - Add Animation to Hero, Header and some components only
        - Add animation in a minimal amount only.
        - Reason Why I avoid too much animation:
          - Beacause there are too many images that affects DOM
          - Adding too much of unnecessary animation make user expreience worse
        - Why I choose Framer Motion for animmation:
          - Suitable for React
          - Easy to use
          - Already Create multiple projects
          - Add CreateBrowserRouter to view 404 page
